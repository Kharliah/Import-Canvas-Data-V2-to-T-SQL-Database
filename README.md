Import Canvas Data V2 to T-SQL Database

Downloads select tables from Canvas into a CSV file. Requires 7-Zip to extract them.
I manually imported the first files into the database as doing it via Powershell would have taken ages.

The Delta sync script was then created and runs nightly updating or inserting.
